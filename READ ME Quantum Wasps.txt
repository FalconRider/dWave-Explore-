A deriivative inspired by Victoria G's antennas problem.
Just for practice at putting what sounds like a real problem into  a Qubo and getting it to run on Leap. This may not work or be screwed up logic but what the hay!

STORY
Quantum Wasps are territorial. THey will not build a nest next to a tree that already 
has a Quntum Wasps nest. Farmer Weber has an apple orchard of 9 grid spaced trees.
How many Wasps nests  can his orchard hold, how many configurations  and what are the tree configurations?

Intuitively I get 4 nests, 2 possible configs. 4 corners or a 4 mid sides in a cross pattern.


THE GRID
A 9 node grid like a dial pad
1   2   3
4  5   6
7  8   9

The array pairs would represent illegible edges.
Eligible edges would not be noted.
The array pairs would be (1,2)(2,3)(4,5)(5,6)(7,8)(8,9)(1,4)(2,5)(3,6)(4,7)(5,8)(6,9)
So 9 nodes, 12 edges
