Thinkering around with a new Leap account.

So far based on examples I've seen, thinking my first Qubo will be a BGP variariant.

The Byzantine bit has been big in crypto consensus mechs and I'll proceed with exploring a
Quantum Consensus Mechanism angle. I think Quantum's speed advantage would be appreciated 
for TPS improvements. I know, every validator having a Quantum computer might be a while. 
Maybe cloud accounts. It's just research. Something like The Byzantine Chefs Problem: Chicken or Fish. ;)

This is gonna take some study and work.

First Project that worked:  Quantum Wasps. Quantum Wasps are territorial.  
A derivative inspired by Victoria G's antennas problem. 2 variant's python scripts and results pics 
with multiple attempts posted here. I didn't get what I expected at first, figured out why and redid.
Notes in the scripts as comments.

Second twist on this VGA  model:   Sentry assigment around a Pyramid shaped camp with a set of 9 Watchtowers.
Post minimum senties to patrol around 3 sided 9 tower perimeter. 
Assigned every second watchtower to patrol back and forth 
between start tower and next highest two protecting central building #5.
How many needed. Starting positions, and alternatives.

 This came back with a number of alternatives on succesive runs. As expected.

Proceeding.
