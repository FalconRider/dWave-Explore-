# dWave-Explore-
Thinkering around with a new Leap account.
This is gonna take some study and work.

-----
First Project that worked:  Quantum Wasps. Quantum Wasps are territorial.  
A derivative inspired by Victoria G's antennas problem. 2 variant's python scripts and results pics 
with multiple attempts posted here. I didn't get what I expected at first, figured out why and redid.
Notes in the scripts as comments.

-------
Second twist on this VGA  model: WATCHTOWERS. Post minimum senties to patrol around 3 sided 9 watchtower perimeter. 
Assigned every second tower to patrol back and forth between start tower and next highest two
protecting central building #5. How many needed. Starting positions, and alternatives. 
This came back with a number of alternative starts on succesive runs. As expected. See results pic.

---------------




Proceeding.
