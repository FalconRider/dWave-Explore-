Thinkering around with a new Leap account.

So far based on examples I've seen, thinking my first Qubo will be a BGP variariant.

The Byzantine bit has been big in crypto consensus mechs and I'll proceed with exploring a
Quantum Consensus Mechanism angle. I think Quantum's speed advantage would be appreciated 
for TPS improvements. I know, every validator having a Quantum computer might be a while. 
Maybe cloud accounts. It's just research.

Something like The Byzantine Chefs Problem: Chicken or Fish. ;)

This is gonna take some study and work.

Proceeding.
